      <h2>Cariye Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>By default, Cariye does not store any data. When you start setting up your bot, it always saves that setting (channel id, levels and warnings). The bot only saves the server settings, nothing more.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if you want to delete this data, just kick the bot from the server, or contact me at <a href="https://discord.gg/J4wDA93rjd">Cariye's Community</a>.</p>
        <p>Also look the <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Cariye Terms of Services</h2>
  <body>
    <p>It is forbidden to violate the terms and conditions of the Cariye ToS bot and <a href="https://discord.com/terms">Discord</a> in any way.</p>
    <p>If you find a bug, you are obligated to report it, not to spread it further and not to abuse it.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to block any account in the event of a violation of the terms and conditions, without warning.</p>
